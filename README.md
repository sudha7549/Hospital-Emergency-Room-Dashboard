# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Dashboard
This Power BI dashboard project analyzes real-world hospital emergency room data to uncover insights that can support better operational and patient care decisions.

## 🏥 Problem Statement:
Hospitals often face challenges such as long wait times, inconsistent patient satisfaction, and lack of clarity on peak hours or demographic trends. This project solves those problems by delivering a detailed, interactive dashboard for quick analysis and better decision-making.

## ✅ Problems Solved in This Dashboard:
- **Wait Time Monitoring**: Displays average patient wait time and percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes, helping identify efficiency gaps.
- **Patient Satisfaction Analysis**: Tracks satisfaction scores by time periods to evaluate service quality trends.
- **Admission Trends**: Analyzes the ratio of admitted vs. non-admitted patients for better resource planning.
- **Referral Source Breakdown**: Identifies how patients enter the ER (e.g., General Practice, Neurology, etc.) to evaluate departmental collaboration.
- **Demographic Insights**: Visualizes patients by **age group, gender, and race** to support equitable care delivery and outreach strategies.
- **Peak Load Identification**: Reveals busiest hours and days for improved staff scheduling.
- **Monthly vs. Yearly Insights**: Offers both **monthly and consolidated views** for trend analysis over time.

## 🧩 What’s Included:
- **Power BI PBIX file** with fully interactive visuals and DAX calculations.
- A structured layout with **Monthly View, Consolidated View, and Patient Details View**.
- Clean and modern UI with intuitive navigation for non-technical users.
- **Practice Dataset** – included so you can build your own version from scratch.
